# Process - Programming Project

## Week 1

### Sat 06-01-18
Thought up several interesting research questions. However, there was no data for any of my plans. Decided to turn the empirical cycle upside down and start looking for coherent data first, and then figure out a fitting research question, although my academic conscience was not happy. 

### Mon 08-01-18
Continued searching for coherent data. Found this to be really hard since data from different sources is not compatible in most cases. Eventually I found some data about climate change, an exhausted subject, but with a lot of data. Made up an interesting story about air pollution by different sources and mortality rates of human populations. I submitted the proposal at 16.40, well in time for the deadline at 17.59. 
I thought there would be some kind of introduction to the course, but there was not. Apps did have an intro. I think this is weird, since all data students received an email asking them to be present at 10. We did not really know what was expected of us. 

### Tue 09-01-18
Yesterday I received an email that I had not submitted the proposal. I immediately mailed back and resubmitted it, apparently something had gone wrong earlier. I hoped that the staff would have considered my proposal yesterday evening and that I had a green light to continue. However, the proposal was not yet approved. Moreover, there was no staff until 13.00, so I felt a bit lost. I decided to continue with my idea, at the risk of being rejected. I then saw that one of my datasets had data from 1 year, instead of several years, as I thought yesterday (weirdly, the same data was shown in several columns of the table, so at first glance it looked like several years). So I decided to use another dataset and overturn my idea again. This was successful and at 13.00 I was one of the first to get assistance, and this idea got approved! The afternoon I figured out the layout of the JSON.

### Wed 10-01-18
I continued to have trouble with the JSON. I found it really hard to get the data in the right format. Furthermore, I started working with Datamaps to get a map. The map did not immediately work (even though everyone said datamaps is so simple, and it is, it only has one line but that line did not work…), so I returned to trying with the JSON. Got some really nice help from Jan. 

### Thu 11-01-18
We started with a meeting with our peer feedback group. It was nice to see everyones ideas and to pith my idea. I am really glad that I switched ideas, otherwise I would practically do the same as Xander from my group. Also I think my subject is interesting, which is nice for the course. After the meeting I continued fixing the JSON. Felt really stupid because how hard can a dataformat be. I understand what I wanted to do, but it just did not work out the way I wanted. I learned a lot about csv readers and dictreaders and some python functions.

### Fri 12-10-18
Today no peer meeting, since we have the group meeting in the afternoon. In the morning, I figured out the JSON, hurray! I fixed it with a python function ‘setdefault’ because the problem was that I was emptying the dictionary when a key already existed. I knew I was doing that, but I did not know how to solve it. I tried a try/except setup, but in the end the setdefault function did the trick. In the afternoon we presented our plans to a small group under Tims supervision. It was nice to see all the plans. I got some inspiration about what cool things you can do with D3.

## Week 2

### Mon 15-01-18
In the group meeting we told each other what we had so far, and where we want to be at the end of this week. I have a bootstrap website with a cool layout and a navbar. There is already an introduction on the site (storytelling and explanation of functionalities). Since datamaps was not working with me, I put up my D3 map that I made before. There, I have visualized in the tooltip the landname and the value of a variable of choice. Also I realized axes of the scatterplot (but not in the right format). The afternoon I asked assistance with datamaps. At 17.00, I had a beautiful map with colors according to the data and working tooltips for countries that have data! Before the weekend, I want to have all views on my website, all linked and interacting. For the linked views, I already made an interactive legend with which data can be selected. I will try to implement that too this week. But I am slower than expected, the checkbox will be made next week, as well as the time slider.

### Tue 16-01-18
In the group meeting we told each other the progress of Monday. Xander showed that he made a functional datamap and a time slider that updates the colors. He told me it was not that hard, only a few lines of code. I updated my plans for this week: the time slider this week, and the checkbox next week. Today I want to make the time slider, fix the axes of the scatterplot, and get the dots.

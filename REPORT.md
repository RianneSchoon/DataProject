based on your design document, containing important decisions that youâ€™ve made, e.g. where you changed your mind during the past weeks. This is how you show the reviewer that you actually understand what you have done.

## My application 
Start with a short description of your application (like in the README.md, but very short, including a single screen shot).

### Do you want to live a long, healthy life? 
Most people do! However, even if you avoid accidents and murderers, you still have to face disease, infections, and eventually wear and tear due to old age - to eternity. Nonetheless, we still try to prolong our lifes as much as possible. The success of this endeavor varies greatly. 
#### Let us explore some supporting means of health care and their influence on life expectancy around the world!

### Overview
The health care variables are the amount of doctors, nurses, and available hospital beds per 1000 of population; Life expectancy in years; and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in USD ($). The map, linechart and scatterplot let you explore the distribution, relation, and development of these variables. Additional options to select time and variables stimulate exploration even further!

### Usage
Initially, the world map shows the amount of physicians per 1000 people in countries around the world, in the year 2000. Select other variables and years by using the slider and radiobuttons. As you can see, every variable has its own color. You will notice that not every country has data. Only countries that are affiliated with The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are selected, so that validity of the data and investigation methods can be guaranteed. Variables and their according colors are also visible in the linechart. There you can see several variables for a single country, in time. Click on the map to select a country! Physicians, nurses, and hospital beds relate to the left y-axis. GDP and Life expectancy alternate on the right y-axis. The grey line shows the year selected with the slider. When another variable is selected with the radiobuttons, the line is highlighted in the linechart, and the scatterplot is updated. In the scatterplot, the health care variables alternate on the y-axis. When those are selected in the buttons, Life expectancy is on the y-axis and GDP is in the size of the dots. When GDP is selected, it goes on the y-axis and Life expectancy goes in the size of the dots. Hover over dots to see the information. Clicking a country in the map highlights that country in the scatterplot. Or select countries yourself, by clicking on the legend to highlight an entire continent!

## Technical design
how is the functionality implemented in your code? This should be like your DESIGN.md but updated to reflect the final application. 

First, give a high level overview, which helps us navigate and understand the total of your code (which components are there?). 
Second, go into detail, and describe the modules/classes (apps) files/functions (data) and how they relate.

## Challenges
Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md). Here, we can see how much you have learned in the past month.

## Arguments
Defend your decisions by writing an argument of a most a single paragraph. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution? In an ideal world, given much more time, would you choose another solution?

## Reflection
Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.

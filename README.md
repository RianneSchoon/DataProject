# Data Processing - Programming Project Proposal

We all know the environment is deteriorating. Everyday we face news of rising temperature and water levels, animal populations migrating or going extinct, and the formation of a plastic soup in our increasingly lifeless oceans. Although humans have a fundamental role in the majority of these changes, some people arrogantly deny their responsibility since there does not seem to be much immediate, personal damage or risk for us, rich Western nations. However, humans are just another part of the ecosystem. 

This project aims to depict the magnitude of air pollution by greenhouse gases, and to explore a relation between environmental pollution and mortality rates in countries across the world.

## General layout of the project

Visualisations:
* Map of the world depicting greenhouse gas emissions per country by color. Countries are clickable.
* Barchart depicting the sources of these emissions, and the share of each source.
